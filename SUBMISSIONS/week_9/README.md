# Week 9 Submission Guidelines

## Overview
This week focuses on Data Science Applications and Phase 1 of your Capstone Project Implementation. Your submission should demonstrate your ability to apply machine learning techniques to soccer data and make significant progress on your capstone project.

## Required Course Videos
Ensure you have completed watching the following course videos:
- Day 78: Linear Regression and Data Visualization (17min)
- Day 80: t-Tests & Distributions (16min)
- Day 81: Predict House Prices (1min)
- Day 99: Professional Portfolio Project - Data Science (0min)

## Requirements

### 1. Completed Exercises
Ensure you have completed all exercises in the `COURSE/week_9` directory:
- `regression_analysis.py`
- `clustering.py`
- `feature_engineering.py`
- `predictive_modeling.py`

### 2. Capstone Project Implementation - Phase 1
Based on your capstone project plan from Week 8, implement the first phase of your project including:

**Core Components:**
- Database schema and basic data models
- Foundation of your system architecture
- Initial implementation of key components

**Data Science Integration:**
- Predictive models for player performance
- Player similarity analysis using clustering
- Soccer-specific metrics and feature engineering
- Model evaluation framework

**Documentation:**
- Create a progress report named `capstone_progress_week9.md` that includes:
  - Summary of completed components
  - Challenges encountered and solutions implemented
  - Updated implementation timeline
  - Any modifications to your original plan
  - Screenshots of working components

**Testing:**
- Initial unit tests for key components
- Test data sets for your models

### 3. Weekly Report
Complete the weekly report using the template from `TEMPLATES/weekly_report_template.md`. Be sure to include:
- Summary of what you learned from the course videos
- Your approach to predictive modeling and feature engineering
- Current progress on your capstone implementation
- Challenges faced and how you overcame them

## Submission Process

1. Create a branch named `intern/YOUR-USERNAME/week-9`
2. Complete all required files and implementations
3. Commit your changes with clear commit messages
4. Push your branch to GitHub
5. Create a pull request using the PR template

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:
- Quality of machine learning implementations
- Progress on capstone project implementation
- Component integration
- Documentation quality
- Code quality and organization
- Testing approach
- Evidence of understanding concepts from the course videos

## Deadline
All submissions must be completed by [DEADLINE DATE].
