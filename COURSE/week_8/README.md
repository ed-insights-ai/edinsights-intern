## Assignments

### 1. Matplotlib Fundamentals
- Complete visualization tasks in `matplotlib_fundamentals.py`
- Create various plot types (line, bar, scatter, histogram)
- Customize and style visualizations

### 2. Seaborn Statistical Visualization
- Implement statistical visualizations in `seaborn_visualization.py`
- Create distribution plots, heatmaps, and pair plots
- Visualize relationships between variables

### 3. Interactive Plotly Dashboards
- Create interactive visualizations in `plotly_dashboard.py`
- Implement hovering, zooming, and filtering
- Build multi-panel dashboards

### 4. Soccer Analytics Visualization
- Create soccer-specific visualizations in `soccer_visualization.py`
- Implement shot maps, pass networks, and player comparisons
- Design informative visual representations of player performance

## Project Milestone: Interactive Dashboard & Capstone Planning

This week includes two project components, with special emphasis on beginning your capstone project planning:

### Part 1: Interactive Dashboard
In the `PROJECT/` directory:
1. Implement an interactive dashboard for your NCAA soccer analysis system
2. Create visualizations for player comparisons, team statistics, and performance trends
3. Add interactive filters and selection tools
4. Design user-friendly layouts and navigation

Enhance the existing Flask application in `PROJECT/src/dashboard/` with interactive visualizations and improved UI.

### Part 2: Capstone Project Planning (PRIMARY FOCUS)
Begin planning your capstone project that will be fully implemented during the 4-week period after the course:

1. Review the Capstone Project Guidelines in `PROJECT/docs/capstone_guidelines.md`
2. Create a comprehensive project plan using the template in `TEMPLATES/capstone_planning_template.md`
3. Include:
   - System architecture diagram
   - Feature list with priorities (core, enhanced, and stretch goals)
   - Data model and entity relationships
   - API design
   - UI mockups/wireframes
   - Implementation timeline for the 4-week development period
   - Testing strategy

Submit your completed capstone plan in your personal project folder as `capstone_plan.md`.

> **ðŸŒŸ CAPSTONE TIP:** This week marks the beginning of your focused capstone preparation. The plan you create now will guide your entire capstone development process. Take extra time to develop a detailed, realistic plan that accounts for the 4-week implementation window. The visualization techniques you learn this week will be essential for your capstone's dashboard component, which should present soccer data in an intuitive, insightful manner.
