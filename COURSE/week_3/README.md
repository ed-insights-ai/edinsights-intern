## Coding Challenges

Each challenge has its own README with guidance and hints. This week focuses on understanding key concepts rather than complex implementations.

### Challenge 1: Soccer Match Reports
- **Difficulty**: ⭐ to ⭐⭐ (Beginner to Beginner-Intermediate)
- File: `file_operations.py`
- README: `challenges/file_operations_README.md`
- Manage soccer match reports using file operations
- Practice reading, writing, and manipulating text files

### Challenge 2: Player Statistics Parser
- **Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ (Beginner-Intermediate)
- File: `csv_processing.py`
- README: `challenges/csv_processing_README.md`
- Process CSV files containing player statistics
- Extract and transform data for analysis

### Challenge 3: Team Roster Management
- **Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ (Beginner-Intermediate)
- File: `json_handling.py`
- README: `challenges/json_handling_README.md`
- Work with team and player data in JSON format
- Convert between different data representations

### Challenge 4: Soccer Data API Client
- **Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐ (Beginner-Intermediate to Intermediate)
- File: `api_integration.py`
- README: `challenges/api_integration_README.md`
- Connect to soccer data APIs
- Process and use data from external sources

## Project Milestone: Data Integration Plan

In the `PROJECT/` directory, create a document outlining:

1. NCAA soccer data sources you'll use
   - Official NCAA statistics websites and APIs
   - School athletic department data
   - Sports data services with college soccer coverage
   - Public datasets with relevant information

2. Data extraction approach
   - Which extraction methods to use for each source (API, web scraping, file download)
   - How often data needs to be updated
   - Handling authentication and access restrictions

3. Data storage strategy
   - File formats for different types of data
   - Directory structure for organized storage
   - Naming conventions for consistency

4. Error handling plan
   - How to handle missing or incomplete data
   - Validation procedures for ensuring data quality
   - Recovery strategies for failed data retrieval

5. Sample implementation
   - Basic code for connecting to at least one data source
   - Example of how to process and store the retrieved data

Save this as `data_integration_plan.md` in your personal project folder.

> **🌟 CAPSTONE TIP:** This week's focus on data integration is critical for your capstone. The real challenge in sports analytics isn't just analysis—it's getting clean, reliable data in the first place. As you work through these challenges, think about how you'll collect NCAA soccer data efficiently and reliably for your capstone project.

## Challenge Progression

The challenges this week are designed to build on each other:

1. **Challenge 1**: Start with basic file operations for match reports
2. **Challenge 2**: Move to structured CSV data for player statistics
3. **Challenge 3**: Progress to more complex JSON data for team management
4. **Challenge 4**: Connect to external APIs for retrieving soccer data

Each challenge introduces concepts that will be needed for the subsequent ones. Focus on understanding the key concepts rather than perfect implementation.

## How to Approach This Week

1. Watch the required videos to understand file operations and API basics
2. Read each challenge README for guidance before attempting the exercises
3. Use the provided pseudocode as a roadmap for implementation
4. Start simple and get basic functionality working before adding complexity
5. Test your code with the provided examples
6. Focus on understanding how data flows through your programs
7. Apply what you've learned to create your data integration plan
8. Commit and push your solutions following the standard pull request process

## Soccer APIs for Learning

While you'll create your own NCAA data integration plan, here are some public soccer APIs you can use for learning:

1. **Football-Data.org** - Offers basic free tier access with match and team data
2. **API-Football** - Comprehensive soccer data (requires free registration)
3. **TheSportsDB** - Free sports API including soccer data
4. **Open Football Data** - Public domain soccer dataset

Note that most comprehensive soccer APIs require registration. For learning purposes, you can use the free tiers or public endpoints.
