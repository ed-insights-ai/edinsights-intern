# Week 3: Files, APIs & Data Management

## Learning Objectives
- Work with file operations (reading, writing, parsing)
- Understand different file formats (txt, CSV, JSON)
- Use APIs to access and retrieve data
- Apply error handling techniques
- Process and transform data efficiently

## Required Course Videos
Complete the following course videos before starting this week's assignments:

1. **Day 24: Files, Directories and Paths** (1hr 3min)
   - Working with file systems
   - Reading and writing files
   - Managing file paths

2. **Day 25: Working with CSV Data and the Pandas Library** (1hr 15min)
   - CSV file processing
   - Introduction to pandas
   - Data frames and series

3. **Day 30: Errors, Exceptions and JSON Data** (1hr 5min)
   - Error handling with try/except
   - Working with JSON data
   - Saving and loading data

4. **Day 33: API Endpoints & API Parameters** (52min)
   - Making API requests
   - Working with API responses
   - Handling parameters and authentication

## Assignments

### 1. File Operations Exercise
- Complete the exercises in `file_operations.py`
- Implement functions for reading, writing, and appending to files
- Handle different file formats and encodings

### 2. CSV Data Processing
- Complete the data processing tasks in `csv_processing.py`
- Parse CSV files with and without the pandas library
- Transform and clean data from CSV sources

### 3. JSON Handling
- Implement JSON operations in `json_handling.py`
- Read, modify, and write JSON data
- Convert between different data formats

### 4. API Integration
- Complete the API tasks in `api_integration.py`
- Make requests to public APIs
- Process and display API response data

## Project Milestone: Data Integration Plan

In the `PROJECT/` directory, create a document outlining:
1. What data sources you'll connect to (websites, APIs, databases)
2. Data extraction and storage strategies
3. Error handling and data validation approaches
4. Sample code for connecting to at least one data source

Save this as `data_integration_plan.md` in your personal project folder and implement a basic scraper or API client for one of your data sources.

> **ðŸŒŸ CAPSTONE TIP:** Your capstone project will need robust data integration capabilities to collect NCAA soccer data. The integration plan and sample code you develop this week will be expanded during your capstone project. Pay special attention to error handling, as real-world data sources often have inconsistencies that must be managed gracefully.
