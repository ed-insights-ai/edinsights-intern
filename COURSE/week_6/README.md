## Assignments

### 1. Database Schema Design
- Design a database schema in `database_schema.py`
- Create tables for players, teams, matches, and statistics
- Implement relationships between tables

### 2. SQLAlchemy ORM Implementation
- Implement the ORM models in `orm_models.py`
- Create classes for database tables
- Add CRUD operations for each model

### 3. Flask-WTF Forms
- Create forms with Flask-WTF in `flask_forms.py`
- Implement validation and error handling
- Connect forms to database operations

### 4. Advanced Flask Application
- Build an advanced Flask app in `advanced_flask_app.py`
- Include authentication and user management
- Implement CRUD operations via web interface

## Project Milestone: Database Integration

In the `PROJECT/` directory:
1. Implement a SQLAlchemy database for your NCAA soccer analysis system
2. Create models for players, teams, matches, and statistics
3. Add data import functionality from your web scraper
4. Implement a basic web interface for viewing the database content

Work on this in the `PROJECT/src/` directory, adding appropriate database models and integration code.

> **ðŸŒŸ CAPSTONE TIP:** The database design you create this week will be the foundation of your capstone project's data storage. A well-structured database with proper relationships will allow for efficient queries and analysis in your capstone. Pay special attention to the schema design, as making major changes later will be difficult. Your capstone will need to store large amounts of soccer statistics, so think about optimization and indexing.
