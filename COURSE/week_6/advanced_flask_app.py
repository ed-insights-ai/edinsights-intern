CHALLENGE: Advanced Flask Application for Soccer Analytics

Your task is to build an advanced Flask web application that provides a complete
interface to your soccer analytics database. This application should include authentication,
CRUD operations, and a user-friendly interface for viewing and analyzing soccer data.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Create routes for all CRUD operations on database models
- Build a dashboard for viewing key soccer analytics
- Implement form handling and validation
- Add search and filtering functionality
- Create a simple API for accessing data programmatically
- Use Bootstrap for responsive design
