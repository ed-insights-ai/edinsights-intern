CHALLENGE: SQLAlchemy ORM Models for Soccer Analytics

Your task is to implement SQLAlchemy ORM models for the soccer analytics database schema.
These models will provide a Pythonic interface to the database, allowing you to perform
CRUD operations on your soccer data.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Implement ORM models for all tables in your schema
- Create appropriate relationships between models
- Add CRUD operations for each model
- Include validation logic where appropriate
- Add methods for common soccer analytics queries
