## Coding Challenges

Each challenge has its own README with guidance and hints. Don't peek at the solutions - try to solve them yourself first!

### Challenge 1: Soccer Team Management System
- **Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Beginner-Intermediate)
- File: `oop_basics.py`
- README: `challenges/oop_basics_README.md`
- Practice creating classes with attributes and methods in a soccer context
- Implement basic object relationships and data management

### Challenge 2: Soccer League Class Hierarchy
- **Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Intermediate)
- File: `class_hierarchy.py`
- README: `challenges/class_hierarchy_README.md`
- Create a soccer-themed inheritance hierarchy
- Demonstrate polymorphism and method overriding with soccer objects

### Challenge 3: Soccer Field Visualization
- **Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Intermediate-Advanced)
- File: `turtle_challenge.py`
- README: `challenges/turtle_challenge_README.md`
- Create soccer field visualizations using the Turtle library
- Implement movement patterns and formations with graphical elements

### Challenge 4: Soccer Player Analytics System
- **Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Intermediate)
- File: `soccer_player.py`
- README: `challenges/soccer_player_README.md`
- Design a comprehensive player statistics tracking system
- Implement advanced analytics calculations for soccer performance metrics

## Project Milestone: Object Model Design

In the `PROJECT/` directory, create a document outlining:

1. The object model for your NCAA soccer analysis system
   - Core classes (Player, Team, Match, Season, etc.)
   - Attributes and methods for each class
   - Relationships between classes

2. Class diagrams showing relationships between key classes
   - Inheritance relationships
   - Composition relationships
   - Aggregation relationships
   - Multiplicity (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.)

3. Explanation of design decisions and patterns used
   - Why you chose specific inheritance structures
   - How encapsulation is implemented
   - Which design patterns you're employing

4. How the object model supports the project requirements
   - Data collection and storage requirements
   - Analysis and reporting capabilities
   - Extensibility for future features

Save this as `object_model_design.md` in your personal project folder.

> **üåü CAPSTONE TIP:** The soccer-themed classes you build this week directly model the kind of objects you'll need in your capstone. When designing your object model, think about what makes soccer players and teams unique (positions, formations, specialized statistics). A well-designed object model will make your NCAA analysis system much easier to implement and maintain.

## Challenge Progression

The challenges this week follow a deliberate progression:

1. **Challenge 1**: Start by creating basic soccer-related classes with attributes and methods
2. **Challenge 2**: Build on that by creating a hierarchy of related soccer classes
3. **Challenge 3**: Add visualization capabilities to see soccer positions and movements
4. **Challenge 4**: Implement a comprehensive player analysis system that combines all previous concepts

Each challenge builds on skills from the previous one while introducing new concepts. If you get stuck, consult the README for that challenge for pseudocode and hints.

## How to Approach This Week

1. Watch the required videos to understand OOP concepts
2. Read each challenge README for guidance before attempting the exercises
3. Draw out your classes and relationships before coding them
4. Start with attributes and constructors, then implement methods
5. Test each class thoroughly before moving to the next
6. Apply what you've learned to create your object model design
7. Commit and push your solutions following the standard pull request process
