## Assignments

### 1. OOP Fundamentals Exercise
- Complete the exercises in `oop_basics.py`
- Create and use classes with appropriate attributes and methods
- Implement proper encapsulation and inheritance

### 2. Class Hierarchy Implementation
- Implement the class hierarchy described in `class_hierarchy.py`
- Create base and derived classes with appropriate relationships
- Demonstrate polymorphism and method overriding

### 3. Turtle Graphics Challenge
- Complete the graphics challenges in `turtle_challenge.py`
- Create visual patterns and designs using the Turtle library
- Implement a simple interactive drawing application

### 4. Soccer Player Class
- Design and implement a `SoccerPlayer` class in `soccer_player.py`
- Include appropriate attributes and methods for player statistics
- Create methods for calculating performance metrics

## Project Milestone: Object Model Design

In the `PROJECT/` directory, create a document outlining:
1. The object model for your NCAA soccer analysis system
2. Class diagrams showing relationships between key classes
3. Explanation of design decisions and patterns used
4. How the object model supports the project requirements

Save this as `object_model_design.md` in your personal project folder.

> **ðŸŒŸ CAPSTONE TIP:** The object model you design this week will directly impact your capstone project's architecture. A well-designed class structure with proper inheritance and encapsulation will make your capstone implementation more maintainable and extensible. Consider how your classes will handle both current requirements and potential future enhancements.
