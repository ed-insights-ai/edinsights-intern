# Challenge 3: Soccer Field Visualization

This challenge applies object-oriented programming concepts to create interactive soccer field visualizations and simulations using Python's Turtle graphics library.

## Overview

Visualizing soccer data and tactics is a powerful way to understand the game. In this challenge, you'll use Python's Turtle graphics to create an interactive soccer field visualization system that can display player positions, movement patterns, and formations.

## Learning Focus

- Applying OOP to graphical applications
- Creating interactive visualizations
- Modeling soccer field components and player movement
- Combining classes for complex behavior
- Event-driven programming

## Classes to Implement

### 1. `SoccerField` Class

This class creates and manages the visual representation of a soccer field.

**Tips:**
- Use the Turtle library to draw field lines, areas, and markings
- Create methods to convert real field coordinates to screen coordinates
- Include properties for field dimensions and scaling

**Pseudocode:**
```
class SoccerField:
    # Constructor
    function __init__(width=105, height=68, scale=5):
        create a new turtle.Screen() as screen
        set screen title to "Soccer Field Visualization"
        calculate screen dimensions based on field size and scale
        setup screen with calculated dimensions
        store width, height, and scale as attributes
        
        create a new turtle.Turtle() as field_drawer
        set field_drawer speed to fastest
        set field_drawer pencolor to white
        
        call self.draw_field() to render the field
    
    # Draw the complete field
    function draw_field():
        set background color to green
        use field_drawer to draw:
            - field outline
            - halfway line
            - center circle
            - penalty areas
            - goal areas
            - corner arcs
            - goals
        hide field_drawer when done
    
    # Convert field coordinates to screen coordinates
    function field_to_screen_coords(x, y):
        # Convert field coordinates (with origin at center) to screen coordinates
        screen_x = x * scale
        screen_y = y * scale
        return (screen_x, screen_y)
    
    # Draw a specific field element (helper methods)
    function draw_field_outline():
        field_drawer moves to (-width/2, -height/2)
        field_drawer draws rectangle with width and height
    
    function draw_halfway_line():
        field_drawer moves to (0, -height/2)
        field_drawer draws line to (0, height/2)
    
    # Similar methods for other field elements
    
    # Get screen object for external use
    function get_screen():
        return screen
```

### 2. `Player` Class

This class represents a player on the field with position and movement capabilities.

**Tips:**
- Create a turtle for each player with distinctive appearance
- Include methods for movement and position updates
- Store player information (name, number, position)

**Pseudocode:**
```
class Player:
    # Constructor
    function __init__(field, name, number, position, x=0, y=0, color="red"):
        store field, name, number, position as attributes
        store x, y as current position
        
        create a new turtle.Turtle() as player_turtle
        set player_turtle shape to "circle"
        set player_turtle color to color
        set player_turtle speed to normal
        enable player_turtle to be dragged by user
        
        move player to initial coordinates (x, y)
    
    # Move player to specific coordinates
    function move_to(x, y):
        update self.x and self.y
        convert field coordinates to screen coordinates
        player_turtle moves to screen coordinates
    
    # Move player by a relative amount
    function move_by(dx, dy):
        move_to(self.x + dx, self.y + dy)
    
    # Run to a position over time (animation)
    function run_to(x, y, speed=1):
        calculate distance to target position
        set appropriate player_turtle speed based on distance and speed parameter
        player_turtle moves to target position
        update self.x and self.y
    
    # Display player information
    function show_info():
        player_turtle writes name, number, and position next to player symbol
    
    # Highlight the player
    function highlight(highlight=True):
        if highlight:
            player_turtle pensize to 3
            player_turtle pencolor to "yellow"
        else:
            player_turtle pensize to 1
            player_turtle pencolor to "black"
```

### 3. `Formation` Class

This class manages a collection of players in a specific tactical formation.

**Tips:**
- Store multiple players and their relative positions
- Include methods to shift the entire formation
- Implement standard soccer formations (4-4-2, 4-3-3, etc.)

**Pseudocode:**
```
class Formation:
    # Constructor
    function __init__(field, formation_name="4-4-2", team_color="red"):
        store field and formation_name as attributes
        create empty list for players
        call setup_formation method
    
    # Create players in the formation
    function setup_formation():
        if formation_name equals "4-4-2":
            create goalkeeper at position (0, -30)
            create defenders at positions (-20, -20), (-10, -20), (10, -20), (20, -20)
            create midfielders at positions (-15, 0), (-5, 0), (5, 0), (15, 0)
            create forwards at positions (-10, 20), (10, 20)
        else if formation_name equals "4-3-3":
            # Similar player creation with different positions
        else if formation_name equals "3-5-2":
            # Similar player creation with different positions
    
    # Move entire formation by an offset
    function shift_formation(dx, dy):
        for each player in players:
            player.move_by(dx, dy)
    
    # Rotate formation around its center
    function rotate_formation(angle_degrees):
        calculate formation center (average of all player positions)
        for each player in players:
            calculate player's position relative to center
            apply rotation matrix to these coordinates
            move player to rotated position
    
    # Switch to a different formation
    function change_formation(new_formation_name):
        clear current players list
        update formation_name
        call setup_formation again
```

### 4. `Simulation` Class

This class brings everything together to create an interactive simulation.

**Tips:**
- Manage the overall simulation with teams, ball, and interactions
- Handle user input and simulation steps
- Include methods for running preset plays or animations

**Pseudocode:**
```
class Simulation:
    # Constructor
    function __init__():
        create a SoccerField as field
        create home_formation with formation "4-3-3" and color "red"
        create away_formation with formation "4-4-2" and color "blue"
        create a ball object
        setup user controls
    
    # Set up keyboard and mouse controls
    function setup_controls():
        screen = field.get_screen()
        screen.onkey(self.rotate_home_clockwise, "Right")
        screen.onkey(self.rotate_home_counterclockwise, "Left")
        screen.onkey(self.shift_home_up, "Up")
        screen.onkey(self.shift_home_down, "Down")
        # Additional key bindings
        screen.listen()
    
    # Control methods that respond to user input
    function rotate_home_clockwise():
        home_formation.rotate_formation(15)
    
    function shift_home_up():
        home_formation.shift_formation(0, 5)
    
    # Additional control methods
    
    # Run a preset play animation
    function run_attacking_play():
        # Sequence of coordinated player movements
        home_formation.players[9].run_to(0, 30, speed=2)  # Striker runs forward
        home_formation.players[7].run_to(15, 25, speed=2)  # Winger runs to side
        # Simulate a pass
        animate_ball_movement(home_formation.players[9], home_formation.players[7])
        # Continue with play sequence
    
    # Run the main simulation loop
    function run():
        screen = field.get_screen()
        screen.mainloop()
```

## Testing Your Implementation

Run the file to interact with your soccer field visualization:

```python
python turtle_challenge.py
```

You should be able to:
1. View a properly rendered soccer field
2. See players positioned in formations
3. Move and manipulate the players and formations
4. Run basic play animations or simulations

## Further Exploration

After completing the challenge, consider:

1. How could you add ball physics and passing simulations between players?

2. Could you implement a simple AI to control the opposing team's movements?
