## Tips and Best Practices

### Effective Analysis Workflows

For the most effective player analysis:

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with overall performance metrics, then drill down into specific aspects.
2. **Use Multiple Metrics**: Don't rely on a single statistic; consider multiple performance indicators.
3. **Consider Context**: Account for position, team tactics, and competition level.
4. **Track Over Time**: Look for trends rather than isolated performances.
5. **Compare Appropriately**: Compare players in similar positions and roles.

### Interpreting Soccer Metrics

Guidelines for interpreting common metrics:

- **Goals per 90**: More meaningful than total goals for players with varying minutes
- **Shot Accuracy**: Indicator of shooting technique and decision-making
- **Pass Completion**: Varies by position and passing type (higher for defenders, lower for attackers)
- **Performance Rating**: Comprehensive but should be supplemented with specific metrics

### Common Analysis Scenarios

#### Player Recruitment
1. Define position and role requirements
2. Set minimum thresholds for key metrics
3. Find players exceeding thresholds
4. Compare top candidates across all metrics
5. Review historical trends for consistency

#### Performance Improvement
1. Identify metrics below position averages
2. Track changes over time
3. Compare with training data (if available)
4. Set specific, measurable improvement goals
5. Monitor progress regularly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Visualization Not Loading**: Try refreshing the page or clearing browser cache
- **Missing Data**: Check the date range selection or data source settings
- **Export Errors**: Ensure you have selected data to export
- **Slow Performance**: Reduce the amount of data being processed or visualized

  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Error Responses

All API errors return appropriate HTTP status codes and a JSON response with details about the error.

**Example Error Response:**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_api_key",
    "message": "The API key provided is invalid or expired",
    "status": 401
  }
}
```

### Common Error Codes

| Status Code | Error Code | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 400 | `bad_request` | The request was malformed or missing required parameters |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | Authentication failed or API key is missing |
| 403 | `forbidden` | The API key doesn't have permission for the requested resource |
| 404 | `not_found` | The requested resource was not found |
| 429 | `rate_limit_exceeded` | You've exceeded the rate limit for API requests |
| 500 | `server_error` | An unexpected server error occurred |

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- 100 requests per minute per API key
- Responses include rate limit headers:
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per minute
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests for the current minute
  - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time (in seconds) until the rate limit resets

If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a 429 error response. Wait until the rate limit resets before making more requests.

## Examples

### Python Example

```python
import requests

API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com'

# Set up headers with API key
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}'
}

# Get top goalscorers
response = requests.get(
    f'{BASE_URL}/api/players',
    headers=headers,
    params={
        'position': 'F',
        'sort': 'goals',
        'order': 'desc',
        'per_page': 10
    }
)

if response.status_code == 200:
    players = response.json()['data']
    print("Top Goalscorers:")
    for player in players:
        print(f"{player['name']} ({player['team']}): {player['goals']} goals")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.json())
```

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
const API_KEY = 'your_api_key';
const BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com';

// Function to fetch player statistics
async function getPlayerStats(playerId, season) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `${BASE_URL}/api/stats/players/${playerId}?season=${season}`,
      {
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
        }
      }
    );
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`API Error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching player statistics:', error);
    return null;
  }
}

// Usage example
getPlayerStats('P001', '2023')
  .then(stats => {
    if (stats) {
      console.log(`Statistics for ${stats.name} (${stats.season} season):`);
      console.log(`Games played: ${stats.summary.games_played}`);
      console.log(`Goals: ${stats.summary.goals}`);
      console.log(`Assists: ${stats.summary.assists}`);
    }
  });
```
