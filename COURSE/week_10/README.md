> **ðŸŒŸ CAPSTONE TIP:** Consider this week as the "launch pad" for your capstone project. The goal is to have everything in place so you can hit the ground running when the 4-week capstone implementation period begins. The more thoroughly you prepare now, the more efficiently you'll be able to work during the capstone period. Ensure your development environment is completely set up and tested, and your plan is detailed enough to guide your daily work.
