## Project Milestone: Capstone Proof of Concept

This week focuses on developing a proof of concept for your capstone project that will be fully implemented during the 4-week period after the course:

1. **Proof of Concept Development** (PRIMARY FOCUS)
   - Create a small-scale prototype of your most critical capstone components
   - Validate your architectural approach with working code
   - Test the integration between key components
   - Identify potential technical challenges early

2. **Data Science Integration**
   - Prototype predictive models for player performance
   - Experiment with clustering for player similarity analysis
   - Test advanced soccer-specific metrics
   - Create a framework for model evaluation

3. **Capstone Plan Refinement**
   - Update your capstone plan based on proof of concept results
   - Refine your implementation timeline for the 4-week development period
   - Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
   - Prioritize features based on technical complexity insights

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Design a testing strategy for your capstone project
   - Create initial test cases for key components
   - Set up a testing framework you'll use during capstone development
   - Create sample test data that represents real-world scenarios

Submit your proof of concept code and an updated capstone plan named `capstone_poc_week9.md` in your personal project folder.

> **ðŸŒŸ CAPSTONE TIP:** The proof of concept you create this week will validate your technical approach before beginning full capstone implementation. Focus on building simplified versions of the most complex or uncertain aspects of your project. This experimentation period is crucial for ensuring your 4-week capstone development period starts with a clear, validated technical direction. The machine learning techniques you learn this week can be powerful additions to your capstone analytics capabilities.
