## Coding Challenges

Each challenge has its own README with guidance and hints. Don't peek at the solutions - try to solve them yourself first!

### Challenge 1: Soccer Stats Fundamentals
- **Difficulty**: ⭐ to ⭐⭐ (Beginner to Beginner-Intermediate)
- File: `python_basics.py`
- README: `challenges/python_basics_README.md`
- Practice with variables, operators, and data types in a soccer context
- Focus on basic calculations and string operations used in soccer analytics

### Challenge 2: Game Flow Control
- **Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ (Beginner-Intermediate)
- File: `control_flow.py`
- README: `challenges/control_flow_README.md`
- Implement conditionals and loops to model soccer match scenarios
- Create logic to analyze soccer match events and patterns

### Challenge 3: Soccer Data Structures
- **Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐ (Beginner-Intermediate to Intermediate)
- File: `data_structures.py`
- README: `challenges/data_structures_README.md`
- Master Python's data structures for organizing soccer data

- **Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Intermediate)
- File: `functions.py`
- README: `challenges/functions_README.md`
- Build powerful functions for soccer data processing and analysis
- Create reusable components for your soccer analytics toolkit

## Project Milestone: Data Collection Planning

In the `PROJECT/` directory, create a document outlining:

1. What data you'll need to collect for NCAA soccer player analysis
   - Player demographics (age, height, weight, etc.)
   - Performance statistics (goals, assists, shots, etc.)
   - Game context data (home/away, opponents, etc.)
   - Team statistics

2. Potential sources for this data
   - NCAA official statistics websites
   - School athletic department websites
   - Sports data APIs and services
   - Public datasets

3. Key metrics and statistics to track
   - Primary metrics (goals, assists, minutes played)
   - Advanced metrics (expected goals, pass completion %, etc.)
   - Performance indicators specific to positions
   - Contextual performance factors

4. Initial thoughts on data storage format
   - File formats (CSV, JSON, database)
   - Data organization and relationships
   - Update frequency considerations
   - Scalability needs

Save this as `data_collection_plan.md` in your personal project folder.

> **🌟 CAPSTONE TIP:** The coding challenges this week are directly related to the skills you'll need for your capstone project. As you work through them, think about how each function or concept could be applied to NCAA soccer data analysis. The stronger your Python foundation, the more sophisticated your capstone analytics system will be!

## How to Approach This Week

1. Watch the required videos to understand the concepts
2. Read each challenge README for guidance before attempting the exercises
3. Complete the coding challenges one by one
4. Apply what you've learned to create your data collection plan
5. Commit and push your solutions following the standard pull request process

## Challenge Progression

The challenges are designed with progressive difficulty:

1. **Challenge 1**: Start here to get comfortable with basic Python operations in a soccer context
2. **Challenge 2**: Build on those basics with control flow for match analysis
3. **Challenge 3**: Learn to organize soccer data with appropriate data structures
4. **Challenge 4**: Combine everything into analytics functions for your toolkit

If you're finding a challenge difficult, review the pseudocode in the README and break the problem down into smaller steps.
