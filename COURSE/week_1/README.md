## Project Milestone: Data Collection Planning

In the `PROJECT/` directory, create a document outlining:
1. What data you'll need to collect for NCAA soccer player analysis
2. Potential sources for this data
3. Key metrics and statistics to track
4. Initial thoughts on data storage format

Save this as `data_collection_plan.md` in your personal project folder.

> **ðŸŒŸ CAPSTONE TIP:** The data collection plan you create this week will form the foundation of your capstone project's data strategy. Pay special attention to identifying comprehensive data sources and metrics that will allow for meaningful analysis. Strong data foundations make for powerful capstone projects!
