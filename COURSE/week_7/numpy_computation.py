CHALLENGE: Soccer Metrics Computation with NumPy

Your task is to implement efficient numerical calculations for soccer analytics using NumPy.
You'll use NumPy's vectorized operations to calculate various performance metrics for players and teams.

The challenge includes:
1. Creating vectorized functions for standard soccer metrics
2. Implementing custom mathematical formulas for advanced analytics
3. Optimizing calculations for large datasets
4. Handling special cases and edge conditions

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use NumPy for all numerical computations
- Implement vectorized operations instead of loops where possible
- Optimize for performance with large datasets
- Handle edge cases and potential errors
- Document your code and implementation
