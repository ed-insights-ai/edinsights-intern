CHALLENGE: Soccer Data Analysis with Pandas

Your task is to analyze soccer player and team data using Pandas.
You'll clean, transform, and analyze the data to extract valuable insights.

The challenge includes:
1. Loading and cleaning messy soccer data
2. Transforming and aggregating player statistics
3. Joining multiple datasets for comprehensive analysis
4. Calculating player performance metrics
5. Analyzing team and player trends

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Pandas for all data manipulation tasks
- Handle missing data appropriately
- Create efficient and readable code
- Document your analysis process and findings
