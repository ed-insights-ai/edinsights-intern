# Week 7: Data Analysis Foundations

## Overview
This week focuses on core data analysis technologies and techniques essential for creating meaningful insights from soccer statistics. You'll learn to leverage pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and various statistical methods to extract patterns and insights from player and team data.

## Project Milestone: Player Performance Analysis

In the `PROJECT/` directory:
1. Implement comprehensive player performance analysis
2. Create metrics for comparing players across different positions
3. Apply statistical methods to identify top performers
4. Document your analysis methodology and findings

Extend the existing `PROJECT/src/analysis/` code with more sophisticated metrics and analysis techniques.

> **🌟 CAPSTONE TIP:** The analysis techniques you develop this week will be central to your capstone project's value proposition. Your capstone will need to provide meaningful insights from soccer data, not just display raw statistics. Focus on developing metrics that provide real analytical value and can help coaches, scouts, and analysts understand player performance at a deeper level. These analysis components will be a key differentiator in your capstone project.
