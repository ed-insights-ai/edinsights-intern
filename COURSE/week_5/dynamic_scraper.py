CHALLENGE: Dynamic Soccer Data Scraper

Your task is to build an advanced web scraper that can handle dynamic content
for NCAA soccer statistics websites that use JavaScript to load data.

The scraper should:
1. Handle pages that load content dynamically with JavaScript
2. Navigate through multiple pages of statistics
3. Extract player and team data from interactive elements
4. Handle login processes if necessary
5. Store the extracted data in a structured format

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Selenium or a similar tool to handle JavaScript-rendered content
- Implement waiting strategies for dynamic elements to load
- Navigate through pagination to extract all available data
- Extract data from tables, charts, or other interactive elements
- Implement robust error handling for various scenarios
- Save extracted data in a structured format (CSV, JSON, etc.)
