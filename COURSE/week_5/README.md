## Project Milestone: Web Scraper Implementation

In the `PROJECT/` directory:
1. Implement a working web scraper for NCAA soccer statistics
2. Store the scraped data in an appropriate format
3. Add error handling and retry mechanisms
4. Create a simple visualization of the scraped data

Focus on implementing this in the `PROJECT/src/scraping/` directory, building on the existing scraper scaffolding.

> **ðŸŒŸ CAPSTONE TIP:** The web scraper you build this week will be a critical component of your capstone project's data collection pipeline. Your capstone will need to gather real NCAA soccer data, so create a robust scraper that can handle different page structures and potential site changes. Consider implementing a scheduling system that can regularly update your dataset during your capstone implementation.
