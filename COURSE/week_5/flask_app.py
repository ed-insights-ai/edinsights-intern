CHALLENGE: Soccer Analytics Flask Web Application

Your task is to build a Flask web application that displays soccer player and team statistics.
This application will serve as a prototype for your capstone project's web dashboard.

The web application should:
1. Display soccer player statistics
2. Display team statistics
3. Allow filtering and searching of players
4. Provide a basic API for accessing the data
5. Include simple visualizations

REQUIREMENTS:
- Create a Flask application with appropriate routes
- Implement HTML templates with Jinja2
- Create a navigation system between different pages
- Implement form handling for search/filter functionality
- Create a simple REST API endpoint for accessing player data
- Add basic data visualization (can use placeholder elements)
- Implement error handling and user feedback
