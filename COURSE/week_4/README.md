## Assignments

### 1. RESTful API Client
- Implement a complete API client in `api_client.py`
- Add support for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods
- Handle authentication and error responses

### 2. API Integration Exercise
- Complete the multi-API integration in `api_integration_advanced.py`
- Combine data from multiple sources
- Process and transform the combined data

### 3. Flask API Server
- Create a simple Flask API server in `flask_api.py`
- Implement endpoints for CRUD operations
- Add proper error handling and status codes

### 4. Authentication System
- Implement an authentication system in `auth_system.py`
- Support API key and JWT-based authentication
- Secure sensitive endpoints

## Project Milestone: API Development

In the `PROJECT/` directory:
1. Implement a basic RESTful API for your NCAA soccer analysis system
2. Include endpoints for accessing player and team data
3. Add proper error handling and response formatting
4. Document your API design and endpoints

Implement this in the `PROJECT/src/dashboard/` directory, extending the existing Flask application.

> **ðŸŒŸ CAPSTONE TIP:** The API you develop this week will serve as the interface between your capstone project's frontend and backend components. Well-designed API endpoints will make your capstone's dashboard more responsive and maintainable. Your capstone will need to expose data through APIs for visualization and user interaction, so focus on creating a clean, intuitive API design.
