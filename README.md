3. **Week 3**: Files, APIs & Data Management
4. **Week 4**: Web Integration & RESTful APIs
5. **Week 5**: Web Development & Web Scraping
6. **Week 6**: Advanced Web & Databases
7. **Week 7**: Data Analysis Foundations
8. **Week 8**: Data Visualization & Capstone Planning
9. **Week 9**: Data Science Applications & Capstone Implementation
10. **Week 10**: Capstone Finalization & Presentation

### Capstone Project
The program culminates in a comprehensive capstone project where you'll build a complete NCAA Soccer Player Analysis System. After completing the 10-week course, you'll have a **dedicated 4-week window** to develop your capstone project. This extended timeframe allows you to create a polished, portfolio-ready demonstration of your abilities.

During weeks 8-10 of the course, you'll begin planning your capstone while continuing to learn new skills. The actual implementation will take place during the 4-week period following course completion. 

#### Capstone Resources:
- **[Capstone Guidelines](PROJECT/docs/capstone_guidelines.md)** - Detailed requirements and timeline
- **[Course to Capstone Connection](PROJECT/docs/course_to_capstone.md)** - How each week's learning applies to your capstone
- **[Capstone Planning Template](TEMPLATES/capstone_planning_template.md)** - Template for creating your project plan

Each weekly assignment includes specific **ðŸŒŸ CAPSTONE TIP** sections highlighting components that are particularly important for your capstone project.

Each week includes required course videos, programming assignments, and project milestones that build toward a complete NCAA Soccer Player Analysis System.
