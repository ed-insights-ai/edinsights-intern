# NCAA Soccer Player Analysis System: Capstone Project Guidelines

## Overview

The Capstone Project is your opportunity to showcase all the skills and knowledge you've acquired during the 10-week internship program. Following the completion of the course, you'll have a **dedicated 4-week window** to develop and refine your capstone project. You'll deliver a complete NCAA Division II Soccer Player Analysis System that integrates data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization components.

## Capstone Timeline

| Phase | Period | Activities |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Planning** | Week 8-10 of course | Initial planning, architecture design, component identification |
| **Development** | Weeks 1-2 after course | Core implementation, database setup, feature development |
| **Refinement** | Weeks 3-4 after course | Testing, debugging, optimization, documentation |
| **Submission** | End of 4-week window | Final project with all deliverables |

## Tips for Success

- **Start Early**: Begin planning your capstone project by Week 6-7
- **Prioritize Features**: Focus on core functionality first, then add enhancements
- **Regular Testing**: Test components as you build them, not just at the end
- **Get Feedback**: Request peer or mentor feedback throughout development
- **Modular Development**: Build and test components independently before integration
- **Documentation Ongoing**: Document as you code, not as an afterthought
- **Backup Regularly**: Maintain frequent backups and use version control effectively

Remember, the capstone project is your opportunity to demonstrate the full range of skills you've developed during the internship. It should represent your best work and showcase your ability to build a complete, professional-quality software system.
