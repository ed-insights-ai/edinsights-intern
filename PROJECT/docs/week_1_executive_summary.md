## Key Recommendations

### 1. Data Collection Priorities
Focus initial efforts on high-value, accessible data points:
- NCAA official statistics (comprehensive coverage)
- University team websites (detailed player data)
- Game-by-game performance metrics (temporal analysis)
- Position-specific core metrics (specialized evaluation)

### 2. Technical Architecture
Implement a scalable, modular system with:
- Relational database for structured player/team data
- NoSQL components for flexible metric storage
- ETL pipeline with data validation rules
- API-first design for extensibility
- Responsive visualization layer

### 3. Development Approach
Adopt an iterative implementation strategy:
- Start with core metrics for all positions
- Add advanced analytics incrementally
- Implement context factors as data becomes available
- Continuously validate with statistical methods
- Prioritize user experience for coaches/analysts

## Anticipated Challenges & Mitigations

| Challenge | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|:----------:|---------------------|
| Data consistency across sources | HIGH | Implement robust validation rules and reconciliation processes |
| Calculation accuracy for advanced metrics | MEDIUM | Develop peer-review validation methodology and statistical testing |
| Handling missing data points | MEDIUM | Create imputation methods based on historical averages or similar players |
| System performance with large datasets | LOW | Design database with appropriate indexing and query optimization |
| User adoption | MEDIUM | Focus on intuitive visualization and actionable insights |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Finalize database schema design
   - Prototype data collection from primary NCAA sources
   - Establish data quality standards and validation rules

2. **Design Decisions Needed**
   - Storage strategy for time-series performance data
   - Approach for handling position-specific metric variations
   - User authentication and authorization model

3. **Resource Requirements**
   - Database infrastructure (PostgreSQL recommended)
   - Data processing pipeline tools
   - Visualization framework selection
   - API development resources

## Conclusion

The Week 1 analysis provides a comprehensive foundation for the NCAA Soccer Player Analysis System. The identified data collection framework addresses the multidimensional nature of soccer performance while remaining technically feasible. By following the recommendations and implementation roadmap, the project is positioned for successful development during the capstone phase.
