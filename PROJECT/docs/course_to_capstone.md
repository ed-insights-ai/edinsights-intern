# From Course to Capstone: Connecting Your Learning to the Final Project

This document outlines how each week of the 10-week course contributes to your capstone project and highlights the key skills and components that will be essential for your final project.

## Course-to-Capstone Relationship

| Week | Course Focus | Capstone Relevance | Key Takeaways for Capstone |
|------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **1** | Python Fundamentals | Data foundations | Your capstone will build on basic Python skills for all components |
| **2** | OOP & GUI | System architecture | The object model you design will be the structural backbone of your capstone |
| **3** | Files, APIs & Data | Data integration | Your capstone will need robust data collection capabilities |
| **4** | Web Integration & RESTful APIs | System connectivity | APIs will connect your capstone's frontend and backend components |
| **5** | Web Development & Scraping | Data acquisition | Web scraping will be a primary data source for your NCAA soccer data |
| **6** | Advanced Web & Databases | Data persistence | Your database design will determine your capstone's data management capabilities |
| **7** | Data Analysis | Insights generation | Analysis techniques will provide the value proposition of your capstone |
| **8** | Data Visualization & Planning | User interface & project structure | Visualization will make your data accessible; planning sets your capstone direction |
| **9** | Data Science & Proof of Concept | Advanced analytics & validation | Your PoC will validate key technical concepts before full implementation |
| **10** | Preparation & Environment Setup | Launch pad | A solid foundation ensures an efficient start to your capstone project |

## Critical Components by Week

### Week 1: Python Fundamentals
- **Critical for Capstone**: Basic syntax, functions, and data structures
- **Key Files**: `data_collection_plan.md` - This initial data planning will inform what your capstone collects

### Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming & GUI
- **Critical for Capstone**: Class design, inheritance, encapsulation
- **Key Files**: `object_model_design.md` - Your object model will be the foundation of your capstone architecture

### Week 3: Files, APIs & Data Management
- **Critical for Capstone**: Data handling, API integration
- **Key Files**: `data_integration_plan.md` - This plan outlines how your capstone will obtain and process data

### Week 4: Web Integration & RESTful APIs
- **Critical for Capstone**: API design, HTTP methods, request/response handling
- **Key Components**: Your API implementation in `PROJECT/src/dashboard/` will evolve into your capstone's API layer

### Week 5: Web Development & Web Scraping
- **Critical for Capstone**: Data extraction, HTML parsing
- **Key Components**: The web scraper in `PROJECT/src/scraping/` will be expanded for comprehensive data collection

### Week 6: Advanced Web & Databases
- **Critical for Capstone**: Database schema, ORM models, data relationships
- **Key Components**: Your database models will be the foundation of your capstone's data persistence

### Week 7: Data Analysis Foundations
- **Critical for Capstone**: Statistical methods, data transformation, metrics calculation
- **Key Components**: Analysis techniques in `PROJECT/src/analysis/` will provide your capstone's insights

### Week 8: Data Visualization & Capstone Planning
- **Critical for Capstone**: Visual representation, interactive dashboards, project architecture
- **Key Files**: `capstone_plan.md` - This comprehensive plan will guide your entire capstone implementation

### Week 9: Data Science & Proof of Concept
- **Critical for Capstone**: Machine learning applications, component validation
- **Key Files**: `capstone_poc_week9.md` - Your proof of concept validates technical approaches before full implementation

### Week 10: Final Preparation
- **Critical for Capstone**: Environment setup, detailed planning, workflow definition
- **Key Components**: Development environment, implementation timeline, and technical specifications

## From Planning to Execution

During the 10-week course, you'll develop all the skills needed for your capstone while creating plans and proof-of-concept implementations. After the course, you'll have a dedicated 4-week period to fully implement your capstone project.

### Course Period (10 Weeks)
- Learn fundamental and advanced concepts
- Create plans and designs for each component
- Develop proof-of-concept implementations
- Experiment with technologies and approaches
- Finalize a comprehensive capstone plan

### Capstone Period (4 Weeks)
- Week 1: Core Development
- Week 2: Feature Implementation
- Week 3: Integration & Testing
- Week 4: Finalization & Submission

## Remember

Throughout the course, pay special attention to the components marked with the "ðŸŒŸ CAPSTONE TIP" icon - these highlight particularly important concepts or deliverables that will directly impact your capstone project.

Your capstone project should showcase all the skills you've learned during the program and demonstrate your ability to develop a complete, professional-quality software system for NCAA soccer player analysis.
